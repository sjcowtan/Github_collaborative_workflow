<p>This workflow is designed for a small group of collaborators on a modestly sized project which has clear ownership. Other solutions are better for big projects and production conditions.</p>
<p>Specifically, this workflow assumes that any one task will only be worked on by one person, though others may be consulted for advice and code review. The project owner gets final say when a task is complete and ready to be merged into the <code>main</code> branch.</p>
<section id="the-paradigm" class="level1" data-number="1">

<ul>
<li><p>The “owner” of the code project creates the GitHub repo.</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone clones the repo</p></li>
<li><p>Work to be done is broken down into small, self-contained tasks. As far as possible, avoid having more than one person working on the same function at the same time - this will make merging easier</p></li>
<li><p>To work on a code task, create a branch for that one task, and work on that</p></li>
<li><p>Make it a habit to check that there haven’t been any changes made to the <code>main</code> branch on Github which contradict it</p></li>
<li><p>If changing your code to fit with the new version of <code>main</code> is an easy decision, do that</p></li>
<li><p>If it’s not obvious, create a pull request. Other collaborators can give advice, but the project owner should take the lead on the decisions. They may need to work with you to resolve conflicts</p></li>
<li><p>When you’ve finished work on your task, check for conflicts and resolve them once more, then create a pull request for your branch to be merged into <code>main</code></p></li>

<h2 data-number="2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cloning-the-repo"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Cloning the repo</h2>
<p>When you clone a repo, you can optionally change the name of the local directory to something more meaningful to you:</p>
<p><code>git clone git@github.com:ownername/repo_name.git local_repo_name</code></p>
<p>This example uses the <code>ssh</code> authentication syntax because I have found the <code>https</code> authentication to be less reliable. It doesn’t matter which you use.</p>

<p>When you start work on a task, never do your work on the <code>main</code> branch. Instead create a task-specific branch with a meaningful name. The examples in this document are going to use branch names like <code>first</code> and <code>second</code>. These would usually be terrible names, but I am using them so that it is clear in which order to make commits to set up the examples I need, so in this one case they are in fact meaningful.</p>
<p><code>git branch my_task_name</code></p>
<p><code>git checkout my_task_name</code></p>
<p>Push your branch to GitHub so other people know what’s being worked on</p>
<p><code>git push origin my_task_name</code></p>

<h2 data-number="2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-a-new-file-and-working-on-files"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Adding a new file and working on files</h2>
<p>If you create a new file, or you’ve changed more than one file and only want to commit the changes to one of them, add it:</p>
<p><code>git add my_file</code></p>
<p>Commit changes often, at least once a day, or when a phase of work is complete, if that’s sooner. Committing more often is fine - whenever you feel you’ve made progress. Commit one file using:</p>
<p><code>git commit -m "Meaningful commit message" my_file</code></p>
<p>Or, if you want to commit every file that you’ve made a change to, use:</p>
<p><code>git commit -a -m "Meaningful commit message"</code></p>
<p>If you don’t want to use <code>-m "message"</code>, git will open a text editor (on my machine that’s <code>vi</code>) and you can type your message in that. If you find yourself in <code>vi</code> and you’re not a <code>vi</code> user, don’t panic. Type <code>i</code> (for <code>insert</code>) before the text you want to type, and <code>ESCAPE :wq!</code> to save and exit. If you messed up, type <code>ESCAPE :q!</code> (the <code>w</code> means <code>write</code>, and the <code>q</code> <code>quit</code>).</p>
<p>When you’re ready, push your branch to GitHub to back up your work and to let collaborators look at your progress. This can be after one commit or several. It’s a good idea to push every time you complete a subtask, but push at least every day you do reasonable amounts of work, since GitHub is also your backup service.</p>
<p><code>git push origin my_task_name</code></p>

<h1 data-number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Checking for conflicts</h1>
<p>While you’ve been working, someone else may have completed a code task and their code may have been merged into <code>main</code>. It’s a good idea to check for conflicts when:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You notice this has happened, for example on the GitHub repo page or by taking a look at a commit graph (see <a href="#sec-commit-graphs">Section&nbsp;3.5</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>You’ve been working on your code for a long time</p></li>
<li><p>You’ve finished your task and want to create a pull request</p></li>

<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="commit-everything"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Commit everything</h2>
<p>Before you check for conflicts, always do a <code>git commit -a</code>. You don’t necessarily need to push, but making sure the last commits are pushed before you do a <code>merge</code> or <code>rebase</code> is good practice.</p>
</section>
<section id="check-for-changes-to-main" class="level2" data-number="3.2">
<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="check-for-changes-to-main"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Check for changes to <code>main</code></h2>
<p>To make any comparisons with the version of <code>main</code> on GitHub, you first need to fetch a copy of it to your local repository. This won’t affect what you’re working on.</p>
<p><code>git fetch origin main</code></p>
<p>You can’t specify a comparison branch with <code>git status</code>, so you first need to checkout your local <code>main</code>:</p>
<p><code>git checkout main</code></p>
<p>When you do this, <code>git status</code> will automatically be run. You might see something like this, if changes have been made to <code>origin/main</code>.</p>
<pre><code>On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 3 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

nothing to commit, working tree clean</code></pre>
<p>Do not take its advice and use <code>git pull</code>. This is a combination of <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code>, and while you might indeed end up merging, a more considered decision is called for (see <a href="#sec-conflict-res">Section&nbsp;5</a>).</p>
<p>You can run <code>git status</code> again at any point, but remember that it is working against your local fetched version of <code>origin/main</code>, so remember to update that too.</p>

<p>If you haven’t already done this, fetch a copy of main, that doesn’t overwrite your local copy:</p>
<p><code>git fetch origin main</code></p>
<p>Now compare your local version of <code>main</code>:</p>
<p><code>git diff origin/main main</code></p>
<p>If there are no differences, you will see nothing. If there are, it will look something like one of the examples in <a href="#sec-conflict-checks">Section&nbsp;4</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this has the same effect as <code>git diff origin/main..main</code>, if you are more familiar with that syntax. Both show the differences between the most recent commits on <code>origin/main</code> and <code>main</code>. If you want to see all the changes to the <code>origin/main</code> branch since your <code>main</code> was started, you can use <code>git diff origin/main...main</code>.</p>

<p><code>git diff origin/main my_task_name</code></p>
<p><strong>Warning!</strong> If you do this <em>without</em> having done a <code>git fetch</code>, it will only show the differences between <code>my_branch_name</code> and the version of <code>main</code> in your local repo</p>
<p>Look at the conflicts for each file. <a href="#sec-conflict-checks">Section&nbsp;4</a> explains the output.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sec-commit-graphs"><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Looking at branch structure</h2>
<p>A commit graph is a nice way to get an overview of how the branches on your repo interact. This can show you whether you are working with the current version of <code>main</code> (but always back this up with a <code>git diff</code> for rigour). It can also show you whether somebody has made a branch from your branch. This is important because their branch could be affected by how you choose to update the version of <code>main</code> you are working on in your branch. There are a few different ways to look at these.</p>
<p>GitHub has a rudimentary network graph - select the repository’s <code>Insights</code> tab, and then <code>Network</code> in the menu on the left, to see something like:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="figures/github-network-old-main.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Github’s network graph</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Sadly zooming in doesn’t make this any more readable.</p>
<p>If you use VSCode as your coding API, there are a couple of extensions that produce rather nicer graphs. Firstly GitLens, which is a pretty powerful git interface, has an option in the command panel <code>GitLens+: Show commit graph</code>. The background does not have to be purple!</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="figures/git-lens-old-main.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">GitLens commit graph</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>And my personal favourite for readability, Git Graph, accessed via a little button on the bottom left of your VSCode workspace:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="figures/git-graph-old-main.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Git Graph commit graph</figcaption><p></p>

<p>I am not currently aware of an equivalent for RStudio.</p>

<p>This is a potential source of problems for them, since you may have made conflicting changes since their branch was created. Viewing a network graph of the full commit history (<a href="#sec-commit-graphs">Section&nbsp;3.5</a>) is a good way to check for this.</p>

<li><p>The differences change the functionality of the code in expected ways - your bugfix involved rewriting some lines of code, but nobody else has worked on that piece of the code to change its functionality in any way, i.e.&nbsp;your <code>main</code> is consistent with <code>origin/main</code> in that part of the code and anything it affects. Don’t forget to check the unit tests too!</p></li>
<li><p>The differences change the functionality in unexpected ways - someone else has been working on the same bit of code or something up/downstream from it in a way that means your change will break theirs, whether that’s the main functionality or unit tests</p></li>

<p>They will be able to fix their code as long as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The code is integrated into <code>main</code> using <code>git merge</code> and not <code>git rebase</code></p></li>
<li><p>The merge is performed on GitHub, so that the pointers from their branch are updated to point to <code>main</code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first point about using <code>merge</code> not <code>rebase</code> is because when code is rebased onto a new version of <code>main</code>, it rewrites the commit history. New commits with new identifiers are appended to the history of the <code>main</code> branch. Several commits can even be combined into one. This helps to keep a repo with a lot of commits tidy, but if another branch shares part of your branch’s history, it will lose those reference points. Doing a <code>git merge</code>, by contrast, appends <code>merge commits</code> to the history of <code>main</code>, and these contain the same commits with the same identifiers that were present in the original branch.</p>

<li><p>You’ve hit a problem, or have to choose between alternative solutions, and you would welcome your collaborators’ input</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="opening-a-pull-request" class="level2" data-number="6.1">
<h2 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="opening-a-pull-request"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Opening a pull request</h2>
<p>When you first created your branch, assuming you did so on the command line, it gave you the URL to create a pull request, for example</p>
<p><code>https://github.com/sjcowtan/git-workflow-test/pull/new/first</code></p>
<p>This will get you to the page for a new pull request to merge your branch with <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>If you don’t use this URL, you can still get there, but it takes a little more work. Go to the main GitHub page for the repo, and select the <code>Pull requests</code> tab. You will see something like:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="figures/pull-request-start.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Go to pull request page</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>If previous pull requests have been created on your repo, they will appear in the box instead of “Welcome to pull requests!”</p>
<p>Click the green <code>New pull request</code> button. This will open a new page:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="figures/pull-request-pick-branch.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Choose branch for pull request</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>There are two buttons with pulldowns, one called <code>base</code> and one <code>compare</code>. Use the <code>compare</code> menu to select your branch.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="figures/pull-request-branch-create.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Initiate pull request for branch</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The box at the bottom of this page gives you another chance to review the output from <code>git diff</code>.</p>
<p>There is a green tick and “Able to merge” next to the branch buttons now. <strong>Don’t click it!</strong>. If there are no protections in place on the repository, as there are not for this example, this would directly perform the merge, whereas you need to check with our collaborators. Use the green <code>Create pull request</code> button instead.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="figures/pull-request.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Add title and description to pull request</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>You are now at the page that the above URL would have taken you to! But if you had done that, you would have lost the chance to verify that the <code>git diff</code> output was still as you expected.</p>
<p>Put a short meaningful description of the changes or input required in the title section, and some more detail in the large box. If you have particular issues which you would like input on, this is the place to detail them.</p>
<p>Now click the <code>Create pull request</code> button.</p>
<div id="fig-open-pull-request" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="figures/pull-request-open.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;1: Open pull request</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This is the page for you and your collaborators to work on this pull request. On the right hand side, there are a number of settings. If you want particular people to review your code, you can add them in the <code>Reviewers</code> section. Likewise you can use <code>Assignees</code> to indicate who is supposed to work on any issues raised (this can of course be you). Some of the <code>Labels</code> options can be useful as shortcuts to show why you’re asking for a review or what kind of changes you made; <code>bug</code>, <code>documentation</code>, <code>enhancement</code>, <code>help wanted</code> and <code>question</code>. If someone has opened an <code>issue</code> on the project and your code is designed to address it, this can be indicated in <code>Development</code>.</p>
<p>The green box indicates that there are branch protection rules which could have been added to this repository, but in this case were not, since they would have little effect on a test repository with only one contributer. They will be discussed further in <a href="#sec-ownership">Section&nbsp;7</a>.</p>
<p>If the branch protections suggested in <a href="#sec-branch-protection">Section&nbsp;7.1</a> have been implemented, you will instead see:</p>
<div id="fig-pull-request-branch-protection" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure&nbsp;2: Status box on open pull request</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This enforces the need for a code review before merging a branch into <code>main</code>. I am the owner of this repository so I can override this, as could any designated administrators.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a command <code>git request-pull</code> which sounds as though it would do the job. It doesn’t! This is designed for a mailing-list based workflow, and sends the list a summary of the pending changes.</p>

<p>If you think further work is essential, or the change needs to be scrapped, use <code>Request changes</code> (also not something you can do to your own pull request). It will not be possible to merge the code until you have agreed that these have been addressed.</p>
<p>If you have some useful input but do not think it is important enough to affect whether the code can be merged, use <code>Comment</code>.</p>

<p>Once you have addressed all of the issues raised in conversation or formally flagged as requiring review on your pull request, and somebody has approved the final version, the repository owner should merge your branch (<a href="#sec-merge-pull">Section&nbsp;7.2</a>). At this stage you can pull the new version of <code>main</code></p>
<p><code>git checkout main</code></p>
<p><code>git pull origin main</code></p>
<p>and then delete your local branch:</p>
<p><code>git branch -d my-task-name</code></p>
<p>This will give you a warning if it hasn’t actually been merged.</p>
<p>If the repository owner hasn’t deleted your branch from GitHub, you can do it with</p>
<p><code>git push origin :my-task-name</code></p>
<p>This helps to keep both your local repository and the central one clean. Your commit history is not lost because it is now part of the history of the <code>main</code> branch.</p>
